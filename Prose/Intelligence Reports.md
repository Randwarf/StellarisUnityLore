In the 216 days since ~~United Kwerdanity~~ the ~~United Planets~~ Utopia Project first discovered alien life our agency has done its utmost to evaluate them, both as possible allies and friends to our people, or as prospective threats. Attached to this document is a short summary of all the sapient alien life that the Utopia Project has encountered, arranged in chronological order of encountering them:

## The Sherakandan Structure
Discovered in 2204 by the exploration crew of the Thunderer, the Sherakandan structure is incredibly ancient. Judging from the architectural designs and materials used in its construction they were thousands of days more advanced than our current levels of technology. Analysts are unsure as to its purpose, with theories ranging from deep space telemetry to a nursery environment intended for raising these peoples' young.

Threat Rating: Minimal. The civilisation that created the Sherakandan structure appears to be long gone, either from merely this part of the galaxy or have become extinct due to some unknown cause.

## The Grunur
We were first made aware of the Grunur in 2206 when colonial surveyors in the Nietz system found traces of an ancient Grunur administrative complex on the moon of ~~Nietz 4~~ Nietz McNietzyface. Their records indicated that they had waged war on a plantoid species, perhaps similar to Kwerdans in size, in order to seize their planets and resources.

Further investigation into Peya 3a revealed it to be a former Baol colony that had been firebombed by the Grunur empire. Assuming that the depletion of the biosphere was instant across the planet, analysts have thus been able to determine that the Grunur-Baol conflict took place approximately 360,000 days ago.

Threat Rating: Minimal to High. Depending on whether the Grunur still exist. If the Grunur are still in existence they would be a highly advanced imperial power. If they have died in the time since their conquest of Baol space then their threat rating is naturally minimal. 

We advise sending ambassadors to the Halycon Dawn who claim to have a recorded history an order of magnitude longer than this.

## The Baol
Archaeological research done on Peya 3a revealed that the Baol were some form of eusocial organism, connected via psionic and neural pathways to cooperate together. They employed 'biological technology' extensively, which has unfortunately mostly decomposed since. The prominent scientist Bodemelqart was able to discover the remains of a colony in the Bluehawk system that had been reduced to fragments and is currently investigating.

Threat Rating: Minimal. They appear to have been tragically genocided by the Grunur Empire.

## The Curator Order
The Curator Order reside in the Phiroza system. They are predominantly made up of Usanace. Their social structure resembles that of a Joneel monastery but rather than spiritual wisdom they instead sell guidance into research for vast amounts of energy.

Threat Rating: High. Their knowledge of physics, biology and engineering far outstrips any known civilisation. It is imperative that they not be provoked in any way.

## The Tiyanki
First encountered in 2210 by Monarch of the Universe, the Tiyanki appear to be animalia capable of faster than light travel via purely organic methods. They graze on stellar matter and form large herds.

Threat Rating: Minimal. The Tiyanki have been content to mostly ignore our vessels so it is advisable that we do the same for now. In the future, once we discover how they graze and fly through space, it may be necessary to begin preservation efforts.

## Collegium of the Great Maunavi Academies
We made first official contact with the Collegium in 2219. They were apparently unprepared to converse with another sophont civilisation at this point, not believing them to be likely to exist.

Observant Eshtart appears to currently represent the interests of the Collegium, though it is uncertain as to what degree of power this individual holds in their society.

Overall, their society appears to be quite isolationist, and, dare we say it, xenophobic. They do not seem to want to make contact with outside civilisation, though recent telemetry indicates that they have had a few small scale conflicts with the Halycon Dawn so far. They hold learning and science in high esteem and appear to take pride in their long scholastic traditions which must have continued unbroken for quite some time.

Threat Rating: The Collegium seems to possess technological and military power comparable to our own. Thus, any conflict would be costly on both sides, morally and physically. Fortunately unlike their other neighbour that we know of they seem culturally less disposed to violence inflicted by the State unless it is only inflicted upon its own citizens.

We advise our ambassadors to continue sending cultural artefacts their way. While they refused our initial offers, our crafters are employing increasingly sophisticated methods that will most likely intrigue these learned people. The more our peoples come to know each other the more they may come to understand our Utopian Ideals. To borrow a word from my progeny's animated pictures, they may have a love/disgust attitude. We believe that they would be a trustworthy neighbour or even ally as long as we respect their sovereignty.

## The Final Order of Osiris
Little is known about this civilisation. They have been difficult to evaluate, perhaps owing to the high number of State Enforcers in their borders.

They appear to follow what we can only describe as a 'might makes right' view somewhat reminiscent of Halcyon Dawn. Under their described philosophies self-determination appears to be less of a right and more something to be earned. They are incredibly resource-hungry, with a colonial policy reminiscent of the Kal'vahnist and Desert Weaver states.

Threat Rating: High. This is a highly militarised authoritarian state with technology and might comparable to our own, if not higher. 

We advise extreme caution when dealing with the Final Order, and to extensively fortify the Qamm, Romonox, Acculum and Sherakanda systems. We should also pursue a policy of friendly relations for now.

## The Five Banner Consillidation
Bordering Krash and Carnno, the majority Za'tan peoples of the Five Banner Consolidation appears to be some kind of 'pirate cabal'. The actual Trazone governments appear to be mostly ceremonial. We are unsure as to how this might affect their relationship with the highly informal Utopian Project goverments.

One of their factions, the Flying Dragons, has established a minor port on Ne'kuma. For now it seems to be only dealing in legal - on Ne'kuma at least -  narcotics and other goods, but the intrinsic secrecy with which they conduct their desert weaving leads us to believe that they could already be dealing in illegal goods without our knowing. They have also made efforts to gain insiders within our power structures, though the attempts have been so far clumsy owing to our current lack of inter-cultural exposure. As our peoples become more familiar with each other this is likely to change. Fortunately, on the whole the Five Banners' pirate organisations seem to be more ethical than our own historical Sa'lahian equivalents.

Threat Level - Low, and High. If care is not taken, the Utopia Project could fall prey to the same corruption that has ensnared the Trazonese long ago and may start enforcing the same paradigms that our ancestors fought so hard to abolish. Any interactions with the Five Banners' Pirates should be strictly monitored for corruption. Other movements between our peoples, however, should be allowed so as to facilitate the spread of the utopian ideal and allow our citizens freedom of movement to what in the end is a remarkable people.

However, should the pirate organisations prove to be too much of a problem, military conflict is not off the table.

## Rioters of Perfection
Due to a freak event in the subspace continuum assisted by ancient alien technology we made contact with this distant civilisation. We do not know much about them at present, save for the fact that they define themselves by their conflicts. It appears to be a religious obligation.

Threat Rating: Low. Currently the travel times involved render them a non threat. If this changes in the future then we expect that our peoples will come into conflict unless a policy of appeasement is followed.

## Halcyon Dawn
Fortunately or unfortunately separated from us by the Maunavi Collegium who generally practise a policy of closed borders, the Halcyon
