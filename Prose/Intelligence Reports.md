In the 216 days since ~~United Kwerdanity~~ the ~~United Planets~~ Utopia Project first discovered alien life our agency has done its utmost to evaluate them, both as possible allies and friends to our people, or as prospective threats. Attached to this document is a short summary of all the sapient alien life that the Utopia Project has encountered, arranged in chronological order of encountering them:

## The Sherakandan Structure
Discovered in 2204 by the exploration crew of the Thunderer, the Sherakandan structure is incredibly ancient. Judging from the architectural designs and materials used in its construction they were thousands of days more advanced than our current levels of technology. Analysts are unsure as to its purpose, with theories ranging from deep space telemetry to a nursery environment intended for raising these peoples' young.

Threat Rating: Minimal. The civilisation that created the Sherakandan structure appears to be long gone, either from merely this part of the galaxy or have become extinct due to some unknown cause.

## The Grunur
We were first made aware of the Grunur in 2206 when colonial surveyors in the Nietz system found traces of an ancient Grunur administrative complex on the moon of ~~Nietz 4~~ Nietz McNietzyface. Their records indicated that they had waged war on a plantoid species, perhaps similar to Kwerdans in size, in order to seize their planets and resources.

Further investigation into Peya 3a revealed it to be a former Baol colony that had been firebombed by the Grunur empire. Assuming that the depletion of the biosphere was instant across the planet, analysts have thus been able to determine that the Grunur-Baol conflict took place approximately 360,000 days ago.

Threat Rating: Minimal to High. Depending on whether the Grunur still exist. If the Grunur are still in existence they would be a highly advanced imperial power. If they have died in the time since their conquest of Baol space then their threat rating is naturally minimal. 

We advise sending ambassadors to the Halycon Dawn who claim to have a recorded history an order of magnitude longer than this.

## The Baol
Archaeological research done on Peya 3a revealed that the Baol were some form of eusocial organism, connected via psionic and neural pathways to cooperate together. They employed 'biological technology' extensively, which has unfortunately mostly decomposed since. The prominent scientist Bodemelqart was able to discover the remains of a colony in the Bluehawk system that had been reduced to fragments and is currently investigating.

Threat Rating: Minimal. They appear to have been tragically genocided by the Grunur Empire.

## The Curator Order
The Curator Order reside in the Phiroza system. They are predominantly made up of Usanace. Their social structure resembles that of a Joneel monastery but rather than spiritual wisdom they instead sell guidance into research for vast amounts of energy.

Threat Rating: High. Their knowledge of physics, biology and engineering far outstrips any known civilisation. It is imperative that they not be provoked in any way.

## The Tiyanki
First encountered in 2210 by Monarch of the Universe, the Tiyanki appear to be animalia capable of faster than light travel via purely organic methods. They graze on stellar matter and form large herds.

Threat Rating: Minimal. The Tiyanki have been content to mostly ignore our vessels so it is advisable that we do the same for now. In the future, once we discover how they graze and fly through space, it may be necessary to begin preservation efforts.

## Collegium of the Great Maunavi Academies
We made first official contact with the Collegium in 2219. They were apparently unprepared to converse with
