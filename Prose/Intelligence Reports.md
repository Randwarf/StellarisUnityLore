In the 216 days since ~~United Kwerdanity~~ the ~~United Planets~~ Utopia Project first discovered alien life our agency has done its utmost to evaluate them, both as possible allies and friends to our people, or as prospective threats. Attached to this document is a short summary of all the sapient alien life that the Utopia Project has encountered, arranged in chronological order of encountering them:

## The Sherakandan Structure
Discovered in 2204 by the exploration crew of the Thunderer, the Sherakandan structure is incredibly ancient. Judging from the architectural designs and materials used in its construction they were thousands of days more advanced than our current levels of technology. Analysts are unsure as to its purpose, with theories ranging from deep space telemetry to a nursery environment intended for raising these peoples' young.

Threat Rating: Minimal. The civilisation that created the Sherakandan structure appears to be long gone, either from merely this part of the galaxy or have become extinct due to some unknown cause.

## The Grunur and Baol
We were first made aware of the Grunur when colonial surveryors in the Nietz system found traces of an ancient Grunur administrative complex on the moon of ~~Nietz 4~~ Nietz McNietzyface. Their records indicated that they had waged war on a plantoid species, perhaps similar to Kwerdans in size, in order to seize their planets and resources.

Further investigation into Peya 3a revealed it to be a former Baol colony that had been firebombed by the Grunur empire. Assuming that the depletion of the biosphere was instant across the planet, analysts have thus been able to determine that the Grunur-Baol conflict took place approximately 360,000 days ago
