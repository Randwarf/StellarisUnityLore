# Build-up period
For many centuries [[Sa'lah]] was known for its unique plant [[Auldier]]. 
Many [[Desert-Weavers]] would make dangerous journeys traversing the ocean separating the two continents, just to sell this spice to arrogant nobles and many more would die on their way. 

But only during the modern era did this species of algae become more than just a symbol of status - manufactory of [[Vitapine]] increased the demand for Auldier. It also meant that whoever controlled the Sa'lah region would control the drug market and consequently the entire Kwerdan population.

At this point and time majority of Sa'lah was already colonised by [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah]] with only very few major islands being under [[Federation of Desert-Weavers]] control. This meant that the Overseers were stripped away from one of the most vital modern day and only way to line up their pockets was via war.

# Wartime
This was was initiated by the [[Federation of Desert-Weavers]]. They struck a fast first blow and managed to take out multiple major islands before [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah]] responded and sent reinforcements. By the time they had arrived, Federation had already occupied half of the biggest Sa'lah island.

Alas, Sa'lah climate made open warfare insufferable - neither side had the sufficient firepower to push through the enemy frontline in dense jungles, resulting with a bloody stale-mate. Many individual skirmishes have been fought over singular villages and even more Kwerdan soldiers have been slain.
