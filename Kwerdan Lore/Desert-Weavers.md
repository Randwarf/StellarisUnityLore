Desert-weavers were dedicated scouts and merchants. They would seek other potential spots for tribes to resettle after water supplies would begin to dry out. They were also responsible for maintaining truce next to [[Holy Oases|neutral gathering grounds]] and trading.

Desert-weavers were usually claimed by a [[Kwerdan Elderships|local eldership]] as their representative, although independant and stateless desert-weavers were not uncommon. These ones lived a nomadic and decadent lifestyle. Many more conservative elders considered independant desert-weavers a cultural threat, able of destroying traditional hierarchy, but due to their trading power, elders would not dare to banish one.
