Desert-weavers were dedicated [[Kwerdan]] scouts and merchants. They would seek other potential spots for tribes to resettle after water supplies would begin to dry out. They were also responsible for maintaining truce next to [[Holy Oases|neutral gathering grounds]] and trading.

Desert-weavers were usually claimed by a [[Kwerdan Elderships|local eldership]] as their representative, although independent and stateless desert-weavers were not uncommon. These ones lived a nomadic and decadent lifestyle. Many more conservative elders considered independent desert-weavers a cultural threat, able of destroying traditional hierarchy, but due to their trading power, elders would not dare to banish one. There are several documented cases of elders insulting independent desert-weavers by calling them "dessert-weavers".
