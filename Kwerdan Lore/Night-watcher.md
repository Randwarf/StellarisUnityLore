Caste of night-watchers was an elite position for trappers and guards, who would stay up during the long nights and protect the hibernating tribe from [[Orbican|predators]]. In extreme cases, night-watchers would also substitute for warriors during rare, but not unprecedented, tribal wars.

Modern age night-watchers no longer deal with nightly predator threat and instead have become the threat itself - they serve as highest quality mercenaries and assassins.
