[[Kwerdan]] federation that governed southern hemisphere of [[Neâ€™kuma]]. Was an important player in [[Algae Wars]].

# Origins
Federation of [[Desert-Weavers]] began as a humble nameless trade guild. It made little to no profit during the first few generations of it's existence, but the idea of banding together into one centralised guild was deemed vital by many independent desert-weavers.

One of the most important events that lead to the rise of Federation of Desert-Weavers was the dawn of [[Steam engine|steam age]]. Southern lands at the time had scarce supplies of coal and were reliant on [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah|northern mines]] to fuel their economy. This job of transporting needed goods from foreign states was left in the hands of local desert-weavers. Young guild leader [[Subata]] saw the opportunity to monopolise coal trade and he took it. Over the course of three years the guild became the most influential power in the south. Every local king was secretly controlled by their personal desert-weaver as their debts still kept climbing. 

After just a few more years guild's treasury became bigger than any other king's. That's when guild began taking over factories and even entire towns. Once elder kings lost any semblance of power, mercenary armies were sent out to storm royal courts. Federation of Desert-Weavers, after years of working in shadows, was officially born.

# Hierarchy
Federation of Desert-Weavers is made up of 5 semi-autonomous states, each respectively named after their original kingdoms:
- Baltabal
- Noratabal
- Exabal
- Cernita
- Iborek

Each state has it's own overseer that is picked in democratic elections. At first only desert-weavers had the privalege of voting, although suffrage movements have made voting universal.

Overseers are left to their own devices and they are free to pass any laws they see fit. This is supposed to ensure a competitive market across the federation.

External affairs and internal developments are dealt during Overseer Congresses. They are called twice every year (with the right to call an unplanned congress in special cases). During these meetings overseers select a representative and discuss their profits.
