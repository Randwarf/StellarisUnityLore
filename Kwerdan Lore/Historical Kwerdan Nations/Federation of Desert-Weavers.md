[[Kwerdan]] federation that governed southern hemisphere of [[Neâ€™kuma]]. Was an important player in [[Algae Wars]].

# Origins
Federation of [[Desert-Weavers]] began as a humble nameless trade guild. It made little to no profit during the first few generations of it's existance, but the idea of banding together into one centralised guild was deemed vital by many independant desert-weavers.

One of the most important events that lead to the rise of Federation of Desert-Weavers was the dawn of steam age. Southern lands at the time had scarce supplies of coal and were reliant on [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah|northern mines]] to fuel their economy. This job of transporting needed goods from foreign states was left in the hands of local desert-weavers. Young guild leader [[Subata]] saw the opportunity to monopolise coal trade and he took it. Over the course of three years the guild became the most influencial power in the south. Every local king was secretly controlled by their personal desert-weaver as their debts still kept climbing. 

After just a few more years guild's treasury became bigger than any other king's. That's when guild began taking over factories and even entire towns. Once elder kings lost any semblence of power, mercenary armies were sent out to storm royal courts. Federation of Desert-Weavers, after years of working in shadows, was officially born.
