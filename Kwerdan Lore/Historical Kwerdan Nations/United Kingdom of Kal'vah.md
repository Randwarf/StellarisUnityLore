[[Kwerdan]] kingdom that controlled northern hemisphere of [[Neâ€™kuma]]. Was an important player in [[Algae Wars]].

# Origins
The United Kingdom began as a small city state in the Sufete region of the northern hemisphere. The region was dominated by numerous city states prior to the invention of the steam engine. The societal structure of the early Sufete states were a loose form of serfdom - those claiming direct lineage from the Sufete elders were allocated fiefs, and thus rent, by the Elder-King's bureaucrats.

While far from the ideal of the modern United Kwerdans, and highly variable across the continent, the peasantry enjoyed a variety of legal rights that their descendants lacked. For instance, the ability to confront their landlords in the legal arena or to ascend the social strata provided that they had proven their worth in the numerous interstate conflicts that occurred every generation.
