[[Kwerdan]] kingdom that controlled northern hemisphere of [[Neâ€™kuma]]. Was an important player in [[Algae Wars]]. The three main ethnic groups that make up the northern kingdom are the Sufete, Pilks and Baal

# Origins
The United Kingdom began as a small city state in the Sufete region of the northern hemisphere. The region was dominated by numerous city states prior to the invention of the steam engine. The societal structure of the early Sufete states were a loose form of serfdom - those claiming direct lineage from the Sufete elders were allocated fiefs, and thus rent, by the Elder-King's bureaucrats.

While far from the ideal of the modern United Kwerdans, and highly variable across the continent, the peasantry enjoyed a variety of legal rights that their descendants lacked. For instance, the ability to confront their landlords in the legal arena or to ascend the social strata provided that they had proven their worth in the numerous interstate conflicts that occurred every generation.

# Decline of Nobility
As trade flowed between the [[Federation of Desert-Weavers|Desert Weaving Traders]] in the early steam age through the many empires and kingdoms of the Kwerdans, the firm social stratification became more malleable. A new class of Desert Weavers formed, traders and engineers, more able to exploit the labour of the the peasantry to their own ends than via traditional methods. 
# Kul-Yterd Revolution
In the fast-growing city state of Kal'vah the great princeling Gerhammon decried the moral corruption of their forebears and slew their parents. As their parents had been in good relations with the neighbouring cities war followed. Soon, Gerhammon had 'defensively' conquered a good portion of the Sufete region and began encroaching on the Pilkish lands soon after.

By the end of Gerhammon's life their city state's territories had swelled to the cover an eighth of the world's habitable land. Each former city state was controlled by Lords selected from their own self-seedings.
