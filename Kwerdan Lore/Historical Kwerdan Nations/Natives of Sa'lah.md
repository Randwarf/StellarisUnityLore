Native inhabitants of the isles of Sa'Lah.

Prior to colonisation, the Isles of Sa'Lah were ruled by Kwerdan Elderships - gerontocratic councils that regularly convened and determined their laws, and the course of local history.

The Natives were not particularly developed industrially, and gained most of their nutrition via fishing vessels. Once their colonisation by the more technologically advanced neighbours began the native structures were suborned into extraction-based economies - slavery.

Linguistic Development
Their shared suffering created the need for a shared language. Several pidgin languages formed, and the natives began to develop new tongues - both secret and publicly.
