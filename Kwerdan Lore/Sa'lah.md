Sa'lah is a tropical archipelago east of [[Neâ€™kuma]] mainland that is situated on equator.

The Sa'lah climate is extremely harsh and for the majority of Kwerdan history it was considered one of the poorest regions of the planet - the combination of high humidity and extreme temperatures resulted in scarce [[Kwerdan]] tribes.

Nevertheless, [[Natives of Sa'lah]] have managed to use that to their own advantage - coasts of Sa'lah were secretly a perfect place to grow [[Auldier]] while maintaining distance from other planet wide empires. The only thing that prevented total isolation of Sa'lah were semi-frequent [[Desert-Weavers|trade ships]] seeking for luxurious auldier.
