Elders, who were marked and banished from their tribes, are refered as wandering elders. Elder banishment in general is an extreme practice only performed in edge cases. 

After banishment there are usually only two paths an elder can take.

And although these individuals would find it difficult to reintegrate into another tribe, they would still be treated as [[Kwerdan Senicide|untouchable]] - it is accustomed to feed a wandering elder. In return, they would share wisdom or gossip they have collected while traveling.
