Orbicans are nocturnal predators native to [[Neâ€™kuma]]. Their primary pray for a long time were large herbivores, including [[Kwerdan|Kwerdans]]. Orbicans are capable of breeding quite rapidly and are considered invasive in some islands.

Orbicans mate twice every year. They store the reproductive material of their mate in their bodies in between the mating seasons and continually fertilise their seeds. Orbicans drop these seeds along the paths they walk and don't raise their young.

During the long nights, orbicans gather into packs of 20 and begin hunting in order to maintain their energy levels in the dark. This has made Kwerdan lives more difficult and the rise of night-watchers was vital to protect early tribes.

Somewhere in an early tribal age Kwerdans discovered fire and quickly became aware of orbican flammability. They would use predator bodies as a fuel source
