Subata was a [[Kwerdan]] [[Desert-Weavers|desert-weaver]] that later became a trade guild leader and would continue serving [[Federation of Desert-Weavers]] for multiple terms as an Overseer
# Early life
Subata was grown in the kingdom of Baltabal. Their parents were lowly shopkeepers in the capital. After their seedlings came of age, they all gave each of them a cart of goods and let them make their own fortune.

Subata, being one of the most thrifty seedlings in their garden, decided to buy up the carts of their siblings.
