Subata was a [[Kwerdan]] [[Desert-Weavers|desert-weaver]] that later became a trade guild leader and would continue serving [[Federation of Desert-Weavers]] for multiple terms as an Overseer
# Early life
Subata was grown in the kingdom of Baltabal. Their parents were lowly shopkeepers in the capital. After their seedlings came of age, they all gave each of them a cart of goods and let them make their own fortune.

Subada was one of the most thrifty Kwerdans in their garden, thus this gift opened many opportunities. One of the first things Subata did was buy off the carts from their siblings.
