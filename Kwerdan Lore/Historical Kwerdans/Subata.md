Subata was a [[Kwerdan]] [[Desert-Weavers|desert-weaver]] that later became a trade guild leader and would continue serving [[Federation of Desert-Weavers]] for multiple terms as an Overseer
# Early life
Subata was grown in the kingdom of Baltabal. Their parents were lowly shopkeepers in the capital. After their seedlings came of age, they gave each of them a cart of goods and let them make their own fortune.

Subata, being one of the most thrifty seedlings in their garden, decided to buy up the carts of their siblings. Not everyone agreed to this short-sighted deal, but nevertheless, Subata left the castle town with 5 carts in possession. Their next step was to venture north, where they turned a 200% profit on their goods. Multiple trips later Subata managed to forge countless trade deals, forge contacts in [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah|Kal'vah]], and increase their chain of supply. This is also when Subata joined [[Federation of Desert-Weavers|local trade guild]].

# Federation of Desert-Weavers
## Trade guild
Shortly after joining the guild, Subata gained traction among their peers. Subata was seen as an influential trade partner with plenty of future potential. That helped them climb the guild ranks and soon was elected to lead the guild itself. This marked a new age for the guild, since for the first time in it's existence the guild was being led by a relatively young Kwerdan.

During Subata's leadership steam engine was invented in the [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah]]. This invention quickly spread into southern kingdoms and became a staple in many glass-shaper shops. Again, another opportunity was present and Subata was quick to profit from it.

Initially, steam engines in the south were ran using the traditional method of burning [[Orbican|farmed orbican stubs]], but this practice was extremely inefficient
