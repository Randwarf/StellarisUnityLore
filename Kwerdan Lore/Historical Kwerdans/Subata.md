Subata was a [[Kwerdan]] [[Desert-Weavers|desert-weaver]] that later became a trade guild leader and would continue serving [[Federation of Desert-Weavers]] for multiple terms as an Overseer
# Early life
Subata was grown in the kingdom of Baltabal. Their parents were lowly shopkeepers in the capital. After their seedlings came of age, they gave each of them a cart of goods and let them make their own fortune.

Subata, being one of the most thrifty seedlings in their garden, decided to buy up the carts of their siblings. Not everyone agreed to this short-sighted deal, but nevertheless, Subata left the castle town with 5 carts in possesion. Their next step was to venture north, where they turned a 200% profit on their goods. Multiple trips later Subata managed to forge countless trade deals, forge contacts in [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah]], and increase their chain of supply. This is also when Subata joined [[Federation of Desert-Weavers|local trader guild]].
