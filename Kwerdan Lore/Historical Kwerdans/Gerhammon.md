Generally considered the first King of the [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah|United Kingdom of Kal'vah]]. Gerhammon was raised as a prince in the era of the declining aristocracy. After spending a term or two in their parent's colonisation efforts in the [[Natives of Sa'lah|Sa'lah Isles]] Gerhammon returned to a much diminished home - or so they proclaimed.

Proclaiming an ideology - Kal'vah - that combined the previously ancestor-focused Joneel and Greel folk religions with the newly merging martial traditions of the colonialist period, Gerhammon [[Kwerdan Senicide|executed their parents]] for moral weakness and waged war against their neighbours. 

While Gerhammon would never live to see United Kingdom at its peak they oversaw the creation of a regime that would span the planet. 

They were executed by one of their progeny, who was in turn executed by one of their siblings.
