A polytheistic folk religion that imagined the various forces of nature as a large family of nature spirits all stemming from a self seeding progenitor Ne'kuma. In the first sin of the new world Ne'kuma's self-seeding created an imperfect land where the deformed forces of nature capriciously interacted with the good people of the pilklands while the seedlings produced by Ne'kuma's consort the Sun comforted the souls of dead Kwerdans in the afterlife. 

The second generation seedlings of the custodians of the deadlands left to settle the Pilklands and the rest of Ne'kuma. There, they entered a sometimes bitter and sometimes sweet coexistence with their self-seeded cousins.

The deities in Greel are numerous and can embody anything from mountains to diseases or umbrellas.

Greel was particularly common in the Pilklands and surrounding regions. It has experience a short revival in recent years though its more traditional elements have been 'rounded off', so to speak.
