One of the oldest religions on Ne'kuma. Joneel preaches that Ne'kuma was created from primordial chaos from which the masterful heavenly crafter Joneel assembled the continents and mountains and ancient migratory forests before crafting the first Kwerdans out of magical glass and writing their laws in a glass book. The book shattered but was reassembled into a more imperfect form after Joneel departed into the reincarnation cycle. 

Long lineages - where one can trace their ancestors back at least five generations - are considered especially blessed. Joneelian dynasties take pride in their genealogies.

Technically monotheistic, Joneel either - depending on its various incarnations - posits that other deities are simply different incarnations or distorted reflections of 'God' or are malignant demons intent on leading Kwerdans astray.

***
Joneel is not particularly popular in the United Kwerdanity, due to its heavy influences on the [[United Kingdom of Kal'vah|Kal'vah Ideology]] though it has many adherents of less absolutist variants in the former Sufete homelands. Additionally there is a large following in some portions of the [[Natives of Sa'lah|Sa'lah Isles]]
