Kwerdans
- Bulbs swell up with water
- Monogender/Agender (they/them)
- Sedentary
- Relatively long lived
- Colouration of bulbs is hereditary; result of bacteria inhabiting them.    
- Become more sedentary during the long nights.
- Evolved a trap-making intelligence to protect themselves during the long nights.   
- Long and expensive child-raising period.
- The older they get, the more fertile kwerdans become.

<<<Less history, more biology up here>>>

Most prominant Kwerdan civilisation began accidentally - long child-raising period combined with multiple consecutive mating seasons made elders settle down for longer than they were used to. This, of course, led to bigger than usual herds, thus [[Kwerdan Elderships]] became ubiquitous.
