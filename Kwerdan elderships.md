# History
First kwerdan tribes were mainly elderships, due to the culturally universal authority of mating elders. They would collectively assign [[Kwerdan Elderships#Roles |roles]] to other members of their society.

# Society
## Elders
The seat of a rulling elder was given to anyone, who managed to reach a child-bearing age, although [[Wandering Elders|ostrasized elders]] would often be marked and banished.

Elders were usually highly venerated, thus [[Kwerdan Senicide|the act of senicide]] became one of the most horrible crimes a kwerdan could commit.
## Roles
Traditional roles, represented in an average tribe, included, but were not limited to the following:
- Water-bearers - responsible for digging up water wells and soaking up the water for further distribution
- Desert-weavers - dedicated scouts, who would seek other potential spots for tribes to resettle after water supplies would begin to dry out. They were also responsible for maintaining truce next to [[Holy Oases|neutral gathering grounds]]
- Night-watchers - elite position for trappers and guards, who would stay up during the long nights and protect the hibernating tribe from predators. In extreme cases, night-watchers would also substitute for warriors during rare, but not unprecedented, tribal wars. Over the years, different guilds of night-watchers would arise:
	- Glass-shapers - this role became reality soon after fire was discovered. At first fire was used as a tool to deter predators, but after finding melted sand in the used fireplaces, handiest night-watchers, originally responsible for trapping, began creating glass tools, weapons, and jewellery. This role would later refer to craftsmen of any sort
	- Elite warriors - <...>
- Etc.
