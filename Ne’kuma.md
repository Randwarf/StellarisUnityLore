Home planet to [[Kwerdan|Kwerdans]]. Days and nights here last 30 solar days each, for a grand total of sixty days. The planet's land is made up of several desert continents and its oceans are high in nutritious minerals.

Perhaps due to the long days and nights, plant life is the dominant family on Ne'kuma. For a given value of plant life, certainly. Their photosynthetic processes bare a strong resemblance to plants and many cover their important tissues with bark, but are still ambulatory.

Ne'kuma boasted a diverse ecosystem but as the sophont Kwerdans rose to prominence the ecology suffered. While the unified Kwerdans have made great attempts at ecological preservation as much as 75% of the planet's unique species have been made extinct.

## Vorican 

Spider-like plantoids capable of spinning vines. They are relatively small predators, although their size doesn't matter when it comes to hunting prey. Voricans spin intricate vine traps used to catch and quickly incapacitate plantoids twice the size of themselves. Kwerdans have used vorican traps as an inspiration for many of their own defensive contraptions. 

## Svarican 
Small plantoids that have evolved a cleaning symbiosis with Kwerdans. Svaricans lock onto kwerdan bark with their tentacles, ensuring they don't get dislocated while feeding. Svarican diet consists of blighted kwerdan bark and parasitic bugs. 

Nowadays due to advanced medicine and technology Kwerdans don't have to worry about their hygiene as much as their ancestors did. Nevertheless, this mutually beneficial relationship has cemented itself deeply in Kwerdan society - many Kwerdans still choose to keep on average 2-3 Svaricans on themselves either as a companion or a accessory. 

Svarican lifespan is much shorter than Kwerdan. This means your average Kwerdan over the course of their life can house up to 3-4 svarican generations. Many Kwerdan cultures also honour fallen svaricans in similar rituals used to bury Kwerdans themselves. 

Usually svaricans have a green outside bark, but many Kwerdans choose to dye their little friends. Some dye them the same colour as their vacuoles, to make sure svaricans don't stand out as much. Meanwhile other cultures approach it differently and make their svaricans a fashion statement by choosing bold colours and patterns.
