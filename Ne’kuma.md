Home planet to [[Kwerdan|Kwerdans]]. Days and nights here last 30 solar days each, for a grand total of sixty days. The planet's land is made up of several desert continents and its oceans are high in nutritious minerals.

Perhaps due to the long days and nights, plant life is the dominant family on Ne'kuma. For a given value of plant life, certainly. Their photosynthetic processes bare a strong resemblance to plants and many cover their important tissues with bark, but are still ambulatory.

Ne'kuma boasted a diverse ecosystem but as the sophont Kwerdans rose to prominence the ecology suffered. While the unified Kwerdans have made great attempts at ecological preservation as much as 75% of the planet's unique species have been made extinct.
